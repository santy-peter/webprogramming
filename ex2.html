<center><h1>INTRODUCTION TO WEB </h1></center>
Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it usually sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client. <br>

<h2>HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h2>
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

<h2>CLIENT-SERVER CONCEPT</h2>
The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite.

TCP protocol maintains a connection until the client and server have completed the message exchange. TCP protocol determines the best way to distribute application data into packets that networks can deliver, transfers packets to and receives packets from the network, and manages flow control and retransmission of dropped or garbled packets. IP is a connectionless protocol in which each packet traveling through the Internet is an independent unit of data unrelated to any other data units.Client requests are organized and prioritized in a scheduling system, which helps servers cope in the instance of receiving requests from many distinct clients in a short space of time. The client-server approach enables any general-purpose computer to expand its capabilities by utilizing the shared resources of other hosts. Popular client-server applications include email, the World Wide Web, and network printing.

<h2>GENERTION OF DYNAMIC WEB PAGES</h2>	

Client-server applications are groups of distributed programs running on networked computers, and interacting over known communication protocols. Rather than performing all the processing on a single system and transmitting formatted results to VT-100 terminals, client-server applications distribute processing between dedicated server and client machines. This architecture was facilitated by the proliferation of personal computers, whose additional processing power allowed some of the complex processing to be offloaded from servers down to the clients.

<h2>APPLICATION SERVER</h2>

Application Server is a type of server designed to install, operate, and host applications. In the early days of application servers, there was a huge growth in the number of applications brought to the Internet. Those applications became bigger and bigger with the demand for adding more and more functionalities to the application and become more complex to run and maintain. There was a need for some kind of program on the network while it will share application capabilities in an efficient and organized manner.
An application server is a program that resides on the server-side, and it’s a server programmer providing business logic behind any application. This server can be a part of the network or the distributed network.

Now, if we would like to know the purpose of a server program, it goes this way:

Ideally, server programs are used to provide their services to the client program that either resides on the same machine or lies on a network.
Applications come in all shapes, sizes, and use cases. In a world where we rely on a host of critical business processes, application servers are the high-powered computers providing application resources to users and web clients.

Application servers physically or virtually sit between database servers storing application data and web servers communicating with clients. App servers and akin middleware are the operating systems supporting an application’s development and delivery. Whether it’s a desktop, mobile, or web app, application servers play a critical role in connecting a world of devices.

We look at how application servers fit into a network’s service architecture, how app servers support web servers, native applications, and mobile apps, and the current state of application servers in the 2020s.
